> **Superpowers for [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google)** — a complete development workflow powered by composable skills, workflows, and rules.


This repo ports the [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) skills library to work natively with **Google Antigravity agent**, with Antigravity-compatible path conventions, an auto-update workflow, and curated workflow files translated from the upstream skills.

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1 — npx (recommended, no install needed)

Inside any project directory:

```bash
npx agy-superpowers@latest init
```

This scaffolds `.agent/` with all Superpowers skills, workflows, and rules.
Open the project with **Google Antigravity** — Superpowers activates automatically.

To overwrite an existing `.agent/`:

```bash
npx agy-superpowers@latest init --force
```

### Option 2 — Global install

```bash
npm install -g agy-superpowers
agy-superpowers init
```

## How It Works

**Antigravity automatically reads skills before every response.** You don't need to invoke them manually — the `superpowers.md` rule (set to `alwaysApply: true`) instructs the agent to check for a relevant skill before acting.

### The Core Development Loop

```
💡 Idea → /brainstorm → /write-plan → /execute-plan → /code-review → merge
```

| Step | Workflow        | What happens                                                   |
| ---- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `/brainstorm`   | Agent asks clarifying questions, refines your idea into a spec |
| 2    | `/write-plan`   | Spec → bite-sized tasks (2–5 min each) with exact file paths   |
| 3    | `/execute-plan` | Tasks run in batches with human checkpoints                    |
| 4    | `/code-review`  | Pre-review checklist, severity-based issue reporting           |
| 5    | _(auto)_        | `finishing-a-development-branch` — merge / PR / discard        |

### Additional Workflows

| Workflow              | What happens                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/debug`              | Systematic 4-phase debugging process                         |
| `/publish`            | Publish to npm with version bump, git tag, and push          |
| `/update-superpowers` | Pull latest upstream release, re-sync skills, AI-rewrite rules |

## AI-Driven Skill Patching

Skills are sourced from upstream Superpowers but automatically patched to be Antigravity-native. The patching system uses a human-readable spec at `.agent/patches/skills-patches.md` which the AI interprets semantically — making patches resilient to upstream changes.

When you run `/update-superpowers`, skills are:
1. Copied fresh from `superpowers/skills/`
2. Patched via AI to remove non-Antigravity references
3. Ready to use immediately

## Keeping Up to Date

Upstream Superpowers releases are tracked automatically. To update:

```
/update-superpowers
```

This workflow will:

1. Pull the latest Superpowers release from GitHub
2. Copy fresh skills from upstream
3. AI-rewrite any changed workflows and rules to stay Antigravity-compatible
4. Apply skill patches via `.agent/patches/skills-patches.md`
5. Commit all changes with a versioned commit message

---

## Configuration

Per-project settings live in `.agent/config.yml`. Create or edit this file in your project's `.agent/` folder:

```yaml
# .agent/config.yml

# auto_commit: true | false
# When true (default), Superpowers skills automatically commit after completing
# tasks and writing design docs.
# When false, all git commits and staging are skipped — files are left as
# modified for you to commit manually.
auto_commit: true
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `auto_commit` | `true` | AI auto-commits after tasks and design docs. Set to `false` to skip all commits. |

This file is preserved across `/update-superpowers` runs.

## Installation

### Using This Repo in Your Project

The recommended way is `npx` (see Quick Start above). Alternatively, clone and copy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bonnguyenitc/antigravity-superpowers
cp -r antigravity-superpowers/.agent /your/project/
```

---

## Philosophy

This setup enforces four core principles across every task:

- **Test-Driven Development** — Write the failing test first, always
- **YAGNI** — Don't build what isn't needed yet
- **Systematic over ad-hoc** — Follow the skill process, don't guess
- **Evidence over claims** — Verify before declaring success
